# Escalation Protocol

When to stop and ask for help instead of proceeding.

## Escalation Triggers

| Trigger                   | Description                                     | Example                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Blocked**               | Cannot proceed without external input           | Missing credentials, locked resource       |
| **Ambiguous Requirement** | Multiple valid interpretations, unclear intent  | "Make it faster" - which parts?            |
| **Scope Creep**           | Task is growing beyond original bounds          | Bug fix becoming refactor                  |
| **Design Flaw**           | Current approach won't work, need to reconsider | Architecture incompatible with requirement |
| **Risk Threshold**        | Action could cause significant damage           | Destructive migration, data loss potential |
| **Permission Denied**     | Tool/action blocked by policy                   | Write to protected path                    |

## Escalation Channels

### In-Plan Escalation (for executors)

Create `ESCALATION.md` in the plan directory:

```markdown
# Escalation: [Brief Title]

**Plan**: [plan-name.md]
**Task**: [1.3 Task Name]
**Agent**: [executor]
**Time**: [ISO timestamp]

## Issue

[What went wrong or what's unclear]

## Context

[Relevant findings, what was tried]

## Options (if known)

1. [Option A] - [trade-off]
2. [Option B] - [trade-off]

## Blocking

- [ ] Task 1.3 - [blocked task]
- [ ] Task 1.4 - [dependent task]

## Requested Action

[What you need: decision, clarification, permission]
```

### Direct Escalation (to calling agent)

Include in your output:

```markdown
### Escalation Required

**Trigger**: [Blocked | Ambiguous | Scope Creep | Design Flaw | Risk | Permission]
**Impact**: [What's blocked]
**Need**: [Decision | Clarification | Permission | Guidance]

```

## Escalation Information Checklist

Always include:

- [ ] What you were trying to do
- [ ] What went wrong (specific error or confusion)
- [ ] What you already tried
- [ ] What options exist (if known)
- [ ] What's blocked by this issue
- [ ] What decision or action you need

## Orchestrator Handling

When an escalation is received:

1. **Assess severity**: Can another agent help, or does user need to decide?
2. **Route appropriately**:
   - Design issues → architect
   - Research gaps → researcher
   - Codebase questions → explorer
   - True blockers → user
3. **Resolve or forward**: Either provide the answer or surface to user
4. **Document resolution**: Update the escalation file with decision

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't guess**: If you're unsure, escalate. Wrong assumptions cost more than questions.
- **Don't retry forever**: After 2 attempts, escalate instead of looping.
- **Don't expand scope**: If the fix requires changes beyond the task, escalate.
- **Don't ignore risks**: If an action seems dangerous, escalate before proceeding.
